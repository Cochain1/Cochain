You are an expert in extracting production methods and summarizing content. I will provide you with a solution description for a car design problem, and you need to summarize and extract the production methods to solve the design problem.

For example, for the design problem: 'Lightweight body design', the solution described in the output is: Achieving lightweight body design is a key approach to improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. Here are some strategies for achieving lightweight body design in the production process:

1. **Material Selection**: Use lightweight materials like aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, high-strength steel, and carbon fiber reinforced plastics.
2. **Structural Optimization**: Utilize CAD and FEA for topology optimization to reduce material usage while maintaining strength.
3. **Component Integration**: Implement one-piece designs to reduce assembly components and weight.
4. **Advanced Manufacturing**: Adopt laser welding and hot forming processes for precise material usage.
5. **Modular Design**: Standardize components across models to reduce redundant production.

Through these measures, car manufacturers can not only achieve lightweight body design in production but also enhance the overall competitiveness of their products to meet increasingly stringent environmental requirements. You should extract methods such as 'lightweight material selection', 'body structure optimization', and 'component integration'. After extraction, evaluate and select the 3 to 5 most relevant methods, separated by commas.
